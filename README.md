### Hi there, I'm Nilo Garciano Jr.! 👋

**BSIT Student @ Bukidnon State University** *Aspiring Red Teamer | Network Enthusiast | Builder*

I am a 4th-year student bridging the gap between **Software Development** and **Cybersecurity**. I believe the best way to secure a system is to understand exactly how it is built. I am currently preparing for my OJT by building labs and practicing CTF challenges.
